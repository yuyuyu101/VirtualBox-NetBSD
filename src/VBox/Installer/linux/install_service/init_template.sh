### END INIT INFO

## @todo We should really replace the daemon starting, stopping and checking
#        code with a tool of our own written in C, which we could always use
#        instead of the LSB functions.

## A generic service script which can be used, after substituting some place-
# holders with service-specific values, to run most services on LSB, System V
# or BSD-compatible service management systems.  As we control both the service
# code and the init script we try to push as much as possible of the logic into
# the service and out of the very system-dependent service configuration
# scripts and files.  See the help text of the "install_service.sh" helper
# script for more details.
#
# Furthermore, to simplify deployment, we will install all init scripts using
# this generic template manually during the post install phase or at run time
# using LSB functions if they are available (as they should be on most common
# modern distributions) or manually placing the file in the appropriate
# directory and creating symbolic links on System V or writing to rc.local on
# BSD-compatible systems.  Systems requiring different treatment will be added
# here when we add support for them, but we will try to keep everything as
# generic as we can.
#
# In general, we try to behave as natively as we reasonably can on the most
# important target systems we support and to work well enough on as many others
# as possible, but in particular without trying to look perfectly native.
#
# To use this template as an init script, replace the following text sequences
# (wrapped in percent characters) with the values you need:
# COMMAND: Path to the service binary or script, with all required escaping for
# characters which are special in shell scripts.
# ARGUMENTS: The arguments to pass to the binary when starting the service,
# with all required escaping for characters which are special in shell scripts.
# SERVICE_NAME: The name of the service, using ASCII characters 33 to 126 only.
# DESCRIPTION: Short description of the service, suitable for use in texts like
# "DESCRIPTION successfully started", using Utf-8 characters 32 to 126 and 128
# and upwards. 

## Time out in seconds when shutting down the service.
SHUT_DOWN_TIME_OUT=5
## If this is set to an empty value then the LSB init functions will not be
# used.  This is intended for testing the fallback commands.

  start|stop|restart|status
      Start/stop/restart/report status for the service.

Options:

  --lsb-functions <script>
      Take the standard LSB init functions from <script> instead of from the
      normal location, or use our own versions if <script> is an empty string.

  --prefix <folder>
      Use the folder <folder> for storing variable data instead of "/var".  The
      child folder "run" must exist.
