/** @mainpage   kLdr - The Dynamic Loader
 *
 * The purpose of kLdr is to provide a generic interface for querying
 * information about and loading executable image modules.
 *
 * kLdr defines the term executable image to include all kinds of files that contains
 * binary code that can be executed on a CPU - linker objects (OBJs/Os), shared
 * objects (SOs), dynamic link libraries (DLLs), executables (EXEs), and all kinds
 * of kernel modules / device drivers (SYSs).
 *
 * kLdr provides two types of services:
 *      -# Inspect or/and load individual modules (kLdrMod).
 *      -# Work as a dynamic loader - construct and maintain an address space (kLdrDy).
 *
 * The kLdrMod API works on KLDRMOD structures where all the internals are exposed, while
 * the kLdrDy API works opque KLDRDY structures. KLDRDY are in reality simple wrappers
 * around KLDRMOD with some extra linking and attributes.
 *
