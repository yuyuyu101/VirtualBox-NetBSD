# This is the config file for creating Makefile rules for Etherboot ROMs

# ROM		PCI-IDs		Comment
#
# ROM is the desired output name for both .rom and .lzrom images.
# PCI IDs are the PCI vendor and device IDs of the PCI NIC
# For ISA NICs put -
#
# All PCI ROMs that share a single driver are only built once (because they
# only have different PCI-IDs, but identical code).  ISA ROMS are built for
# each ROM type, because different vendors used a different logic around the
# basic chip.  The most popular example is the NS8390, which some cards use
# in PIO mode, some in DMA mode.  Two chips currently don't fit into this nice
# black-and-white scheme (the Lance and the NS8390).  Their driver deals
# with both PCI and ISA cards.  These drivers will be treated similarly to
# ISA only drivers by genrules.pl and are compiled for each ROM type that is
# ISA, and additionally compiled for the PCI card type.
#
# Then do: make clean, make Roms and make
#
# Please send additions to this file to <kenUNDERSCOREyap AT users PERIOD sourceforge PERIOD net>

# 3c59x cards (Vortex) and 3c900 cards
# If your 3c900 NIC detects but fails to work, e.g. no link light, with
# the 3c90x driver, try using the 3c595 driver. I have one report that the
# 3c595 driver handles these NICs properly. (The 595 driver uses the
# programmed I/O mode of operation, whereas the 90x driver uses the bus
# mastering mode. These NICs are capable of either mode.) When it comes to
# making a ROM, as usual, you must choose the correct image, the one that
# contains the same PCI IDs as your NIC.
