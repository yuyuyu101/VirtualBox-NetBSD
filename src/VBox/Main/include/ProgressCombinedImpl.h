/**
 * The CombinedProgress class allows to combine several progress objects to a
 * single progress component. This single progress component will treat all
 * operations of individual progress objects as a single sequence of operations
 * that follow each other in the same order as progress objects are passed to
 * the #init() method.
 *
 * @note CombinedProgress is legacy code and deprecated. It does not support
 *       weighted operations, all suboperations are assumed to take the same
 *       amount of time. For new code, please use IProgress directly which
 *       has supported multiple weighted suboperations since VirtualBox 3.0.
 *
 * Individual progress objects are sequentially combined so that this progress
 * object:
 *
 *  -   is cancelable only if all progresses are cancelable.
 *  -   is canceled once a progress that follows next to successfully completed
 *      ones reports it was canceled.
 *  -   is completed successfully only after all progresses are completed
 *      successfully.
 *  -   is completed unsuccessfully once a progress that follows next to
 *      successfully completed ones reports it was completed unsuccessfully;
 *      the result code and error info of the unsuccessful progress
 *      will be reported as the result code and error info of this progress.
 *  -   returns N as the operation number, where N equals to the number of
 *      operations in all successfully completed progresses starting from the
 *      first one plus the operation number of the next (not yet complete)
 *      progress; the operation description of the latter one is reported as
 *      the operation description of this progress object.
 *  -   returns P as the percent value, where P equals to the sum of percents
 *      of all successfully completed progresses starting from the
 *      first one plus the percent value of the next (not yet complete)
 *      progress, normalized to 100%.
 *
 * @note It's the responsibility of the combined progress object creator to
 *       complete individual progresses in the right order: if, let's say, the
 *       last progress is completed before all previous ones,
 *       #WaitForCompletion(-1) will most likely give 100% CPU load because it
 *       will be in a loop calling a method that returns immediately.
