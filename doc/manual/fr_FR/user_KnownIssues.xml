  <title>Known limitations</title>

  <para>This sections describes known problems with VirtualBox
  $VBOX_VERSION_STRING. Unless marked otherwise, these issues are planned to
  be fixed in later releases.</para>

    <listitem>
      <para>The following <emphasis role="bold">Guest SMP (multiprocessor)
      limitations</emphasis> exist:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Poor performance</emphasis> with
            32-bit guests on AMD CPUs. This affects mainly Windows and Solaris
            guests, but possibly also some Linux kernel revisions. Partially
            solved in 3.0.6 for 32 bits Windows NT, 2000, XP and 2003 guests.
            Requires 3.0.6 or higher Guest Additions to be installed.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Poor performance</emphasis> with
            32-bit guests on certain Intel CPU models that do not include
            virtual APIC hardware optimization support. This affects mainly
            Windows and Solaris guests, but possibly also some Linux kernel
            revisions. Partially solved in 3.0.12 for 32 bits Windows NT,
            2000, XP and 2003 guests. Requires 3.0.12 or higher Guest
            Additions to be installed.</para>
          </listitem>

        </itemizedlist></para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">64-bit guests on some 32-bit host systems
      with VT-x</emphasis> can cause instabilities to your system. If you
      experience this, do not attempt to execute 64-bit guests. Refer to the
      VirtualBox user forum for additional information.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Direct 3D support in Windows
      guests.</emphasis> For this to work, the Guest Additions must be
      installed in Windows "safe mode". Press F8 when the Windows guest is
      booting and select "Safe mode", then install the Guest Additions.
      Otherwise Windows' file protection mechanism will interfere with the
      replacement DLLs installed by VirtualBox and keep restoring the original
      Windows system DLLs.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Guest control.</emphasis> On
      Windows guests, a process lauched via the guest control execute support is
      only able to display a graphical user interface if the user account it is
      started under, is currently logged in and has a desktop
      session. Otherwise, the process will not be able to display its user
      interface. </para>
      <para>Also, for using accounts without or with an empty password specified,
      the group policy needs to be changed on the guest. To do so, open the
      group policy editor on the command line by typing
      <computeroutput>gpedit.msc</computeroutput>, open the key
      <emphasis>Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options</emphasis>
      and change the value of <emphasis>Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only</emphasis>
      to <emphasis>Disabled</emphasis>.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Guest multi-monitor support.</emphasis> This
      feature is currently only supported with Windows guests.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Deleting the only snapshot with a running VM
      is not implemented.</emphasis> Trying to perform this operation will
      result in an error message. This feature will be added in one of the
      next maintenance releases. It is possible to delete the only snapshot
      when the VM is not running, e.g. in "poweroff" or "saved" state.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Disabled host I/O caches.</emphasis>
      Disabling the host I/O cache (see <xref linkend="iocaching" />) will
      yield poor performance with VHD and sparse VMDK files as these do not
      currently support asynchronous I/O. This does not apply to VDI files and
      raw disk/partition VMDK files, which do support async I/O. This
      restriction will be lifted in a future maintenance update.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Compacting virtual disk images is limited to
      VDI files.</emphasis> The <code>VBoxManage modifyhd --compact</code>
      command is currently only implemented for VDI files. At the moment the
      only way to optimize the size of a virtual disk images in other formats
      (VMDK, VHD) is to clone the image and then use the cloned image in the
      VM configuration.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">OVF import/export:</emphasis><itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>When importing an OVF that was previously exported by
            VirtualBox 3.2 or higher which contains a complete VirtualBox machine
            configuration in the &lt;vbox:Machine&gt; element, some of the
            import customizations that can be specified (in either the GUI or
            on the VBoxManage command line) are presently ignored. In
            particular, customizations of the imported storage configuration
            are ignored. This will be fixed in the next release.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Mac OS X Server guests can only run on a certain host

            <para>VirtualBox does not provide Guest Additions for Mac OS X

          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The graphics resolution currently defaults to 1024x768 as
            Mac OS X Server falls back to the built-in EFI display support.
            See <xref linkend="efividmode" /> for more information on how to
            change EFI video modes.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Even when idle, Mac OS X Server guests currently burn 100%
            CPU. This is a power management issue that will be addressed in a

          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Mac OS X Server guests only work with one CPU assigned to

          <listitem>
            <para>Depending on your system and version of Mac OS X Server, you
            might experience guest hangs after some time. This can be fixed by
            turning off energy saving (set timeout to "Never") in the system
            preferences.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>By default, the VirtualBox EFI enables debug output of the
            Mac OS X Server kernel to help you diagnose boot problems. Note
            that there is a lot of output and not all errors are fatal (they
            would also show on your physical Mac). You can turn off these
            messages by issuing this command:<screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" "VBoxInternal2/EfiBootArgs" "  "</screen>To
            revert to the previous behavior, use:<screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" "VBoxInternal2/EfiBootArgs" ""</screen></para>

          <listitem>
            <para>USB support on OpenSolaris hosts requires version snv_124 or

            poor performance.</para>
          </listitem>

            <para>No ACPI information (battery status, power source) is

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Guest Additions for OS/2.</emphasis> Shared
      folders are not yet supported with OS/2 guests. In addition, seamless
      windows and automatic guest resizing will probably never be implemented
      due to inherent limitations of the OS/2 graphics system.</para>
