/** @class QIWidgetValidator
 *
 *  The QIWidgetValidator class is a widget validator. Its purpose is to
 *  answer the question: whether all relevant (grand) children of the given
 *  widget are valid or not. Relevant children are those widgets which
 *  receive some user input that can be checked for validity (i.e. they
 *  have a validator() method that returns a pointer to a QValidator instance
 *  used to validate widget's input). The QLineEdit class is an example of
 *  such a widget.
 *
 *  When a QIWidgetValidator instance is created it receives a pointer to
 *  a widget whose children should be checked for validity. The instance
 *  connects itself to signals emitted by input widgets when their contents
 *  changes, and emits its own signal, validityChanged() (common for all
 *  child widgets being observed), whenever the change happens.
 *
 *  Objects that want to know when the validity state changes should connect
 *  themselves to the validityChanged() signal and then use the isValid()
 *  method to determine whether all children are valid or not.
 *
 *  It is assumed that all children that require validity checks have been
 *  already added to the widget when it is passed to the QIWidgetValidator
 *  constructor. If other children (that need to be validated) are added
 *  later, it's necessary to call the rescan() method to rescan the widget
 *  hierarchy again, otherwise the results of validity checks are undefined.
 *
 *  It's also necessary to call the revalidate() method every time the
 *  enabled state of the child widget is changed, because QIWidgetValidator
 *  skips disabled widgets when it calculates the combined validity state.
 *
 *  This class is useful for example for QWizard dialogs, where a separate
 *  instance validates every page of the wizard that has children to validate,
 *  and the validityChanged() signal of every instance is connected to some
 *  signal of the QWizard subclass, that enables or disables the Next button,
 *  depending on the result of the validity check.
 *
 *  Currently, only QLineEdit and QComboBox classes and their successors are
 *  recognized by QIWidgetValidator. It uses the QLineEdit::hasAcceptableInput()
 *  and QCombobox::validator() methods to determine the validity state o
 *  the corresponding widgets (note that the QComboBox widget must be editable,
 *  otherwise it will be skipped).
